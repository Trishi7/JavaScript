# Task 1: Basic Syntax and DOM Manipulation

### Level: Beginner

### Description:
Create a simple JavaScript application that processes user input for their name, age, and whether they are a student. The application should display a personalized message based on the input. Additionally, implement a function to toggle a boolean value for a separate task.

### Objective: 
Implement basic JavaScript concepts including variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, and functions.

### Pre-requisites:
- Understanding of basic JavaScript (variables, data types, functions)
- Familiarity with conditional statements
- Knowledge of loops

### Concepts Covered:
- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements
- Loops

### Instructions:
1. Define variables to store the user's name, age, and student status.
2. Create a function to generate a personalized message based on the input values.
3. Use conditional statements to check if the user is a student and create a personalized message.
4. Use a loop to repeat the personalized message based on the user's age (if age is less than or equal to 10, repeat the message that many times).
5. Implement a function to toggle a boolean value.

### Example Input:
**Set 1:**
- Name: "Alice"
- Age: 5
- Is Student: true

**Set 2:**
- Name: "Bob"
- Age: 15
- Is Student: false

**Set 3:**
- Name: "Charlie"
- Age: 8
- Is Student: true

### Expected Output:
**Set 1:**
```javascript
"Hello, my name is Alice and I am a student."
"Hello, my name is Alice and I am a student."
"Hello, my name is Alice and I am a student."
"Hello, my name is Alice and I am a student."
"Hello, my name is Alice and I am a student."

### Expected Output:
**Set 2:**
```javascript
"Hello, my name is Bob."

### Expected Output:
**Set 3:**
```javascript
"Hello, my name is Charlie and I am a student."
"Hello, my name is Charlie and I am a student."
"Hello, my name is Charlie and I am a student."
"Hello, my name is Charlie and I am a student."
"Hello, my name is Charlie and I am a student."
"Hello, my name is Charlie and I am a student."
"Hello, my name is Charlie and I am a student."
"Hello, my name is Charlie and I am a student."
